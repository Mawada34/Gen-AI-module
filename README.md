# Calculator Assignment – Jac Language

This assignment demonstrates the development of a calculator program in **Jac**, progressing from a scale-agnostic design to an AI-enhanced version using a Large Language Model (LLM).

Files Included
**calc5.jac** – Calculator implementation using the **Scale-Agnostic approach** in Jac.   **calc6.jac** – Extended version of the calculator from Step 5, now enhanced with **AI capabilities** using the **Gemini LLM**.  
**README.md** – Documentation for the assignment.  

Description

calc5.jac  
Implements a **scale-agnostic calculator**.  
- Uses Jac’s scale-agnostic programming approach to ensure the program can handle computations consistently across varying contexts.  
- Demonstrates modularity and adaptability in design.  

calc6.jac  
Builds upon **calc5.jac**, but introduces **AI integration**:  
- Enhances the calculator by integrating with **Gemini (LLM)**.  
- Allows the calculator not only to compute values but also to interpret answers in wording **natural languange**  
- Showcases the combination of symbolic computation and generative AI.
